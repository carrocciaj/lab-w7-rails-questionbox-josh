# Using the All-The-Answers API

Welcome to the All-The-Answers API, this doc will guide you through the use of our API.

All API access is over HTTP, and accessed from https://all-the-answers.herokuapp.com/api/. All data is sent and received as JSON.

## Authentication

Authencation is done through HTTP Token Authentican. Each User will be provided a token on registred. Registration route is an unauthenticated route. To access tokens you will need to login or create a user.

### To Create a User:

go to `/users` to create a user as a POST request  

The request body should be:
```json
{ "user": 
      {
        "first_name": "first_name",
        "last_name": "last_name",
        "username": "username",
        "email": "email",
        "password": "password"
      }
}
```
The response will be:
```json
{
    "id": 00,
    "username": "bk1311",
    "email": "josh@gmail.com",
    "first_name": "Josh",
    "last_name": "Carroccia",
    "password_digest": "$2a$10$AKkKALZ3wUmgfFT1RcuKTOM97eiin/bSWMqVHDGVbuop..GkJYY4e",
    "created_at": "2018-09-17T19:15:40.646Z",
    "updated_at": "2018-09-17T19:15:40.646Z",
    "api_token": "gRgmeaeDgMeo99cSfoBEW3gi"
}
```

### If User exist 

  Go to `/session` to login with username and password  
  On successful login the response will be the Users's api_token  

## Users

  Users can ask questions, answer questions and can mark answers to their questions as valid  

### Getting Profile Info 

  Must be authenticated by using your token
  To go to your User Profile, `GET /profile`   
  Response will be:  
  ```json
  {
    "links": {
        "self": "/api/profile",
        "update": {
            "method": "PUT",
            "href": "https://all-the-answers.herokuapp.com/api/users/2"
        },
        "delete": {
            "method": "DELETE",
            "href": "https://all-the-answers.herokuapp.com/api/users/2"
        }
    },
    "data": {
        "id": 2,
        "attributes": {
            "first_name": "Josh",
            "last_name": "Carroccia",
            "username": "bk1311",
            "email": "josh@gmail.com",
            "api_token": "gRgmeaeDgMeo99cSfoBEW3gi",
            "questions": 0,
            "answers": 0
        }
    }
  }
  ```
  The JSON resonse shows you the endpaths to update or delete. Only owners of the profile can use those methods

          "username": "north_king",
          "created_at": "2018-09-17T19:02:07.693Z"
      },
      {
          "id": 2,
          "username": "bk1311",
          "created_at": "2018-09-17T19:15:40.646Z"
      }
   ]
